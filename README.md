# TensorFlow 1.0 Python 2.7 Jupyter

Basic image, with TensorFlow and Jupyter. Could be used to quickly start with TensorFlow in Kitematic.  Quite light-weight. Based on Debian base. Uses Anaconda(mini) - with minimal amount of scientific packages. Does the "smart" container persistence (doesn't overwrite your modifications to examples)
